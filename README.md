# DrivingDemo

<strong> Description </strong></p>
I made this to test out making a car from scratch in unity. I then got what I learned making this, refined it, and tried to put it in my driving video game I made for a state and national competition in high school. 

<strong> What I learned </strong> 
* Character Controller Design
* Design ethics of realism vs fun
